      <p>oh, right. i'm adelheidis, but everyone calls me alice. it's not a name i dislike, it's just something i never really asked to be called. all my friends call me that because it's easier to say. my friend, doll, has been active, because she isn't in the angel reembodiment program. in times of emergency, our artificial bodies are shut down, and the rest are left to deal with the issue. i don't really know anyone else who's in the program, but i do remember many names on the list.</p><br><br>
