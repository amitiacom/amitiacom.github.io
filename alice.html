      <p>"hi, it's nice to meet you. my name is adelheidis, but most people call me alice, despite me never asking to be called that. i'm still okay with it though, and they say it's just because alice is shorter. i like my friends, i like to write and draw, i like to listen to music, and i like to go outside and see what might be waiting for me. i'm in the angel reembodiment program, which means i support and have taken part in giving angels bodies that can interact with everything just like how the humans did. the only downside is that i can't do a lot of things i used to be able to do, but i'm still happier this way."</p><br>
